"""Byte-exact tensor synthesis, shared with `tests/test_kernels.rs`.

The fixture that `generate_references.py` writes carries **only expected outputs**. Every
*input* a kernel test needs -- activations, weights, scales, masks, RoPE tables -- is
synthesized independently on both sides from this module's functions, and
`test_kernels.rs` implements exactly the same arithmetic.

Two properties make that safe to rely on:

- **Stateless addressing.** An element's value depends only on its tensor's *name* and
  its own index -- never on a running stream. Tests can be added, removed or reordered
  and no other tensor's bytes move.
- **No cross-language float conversion.** Values are built from raw bit patterns and the
  f32->bf16 rounding is spelled out here (`f32_to_bf16_bits`) rather than delegated to
  `torch`/`half`, so both sides run the identical algorithm rather than two
  implementations that are merely expected to agree.

Where a value genuinely cannot be built from bits -- the RoPE tables need `cos`/`sin` --
the computation runs in **f64** and is narrowed f64 -> f32 -> bf16. A last-ulp
disagreement between two libm implementations then has to also straddle a bf16 rounding
boundary to matter, which is ~2^-44 per element.

Belt and braces: `generate_references.py` records `checksum()` of every input it
synthesizes into the fixture, and `test_kernels.rs` verifies its own synthesis against
those before launching anything. If the two implementations ever diverge, the run fails
immediately with the offending tensor's name instead of surfacing as a plausible-looking
numeric error.
